## Why EML?

Archival, open data is great ... blah blah.  Good reuse is all about good Metadata blah blah...

But specifying metadata is typically onerous, time-consuming and error prone.  Your metadata doesn't define your date format/missing value character/etc etc?  What, that's metadata too?  Wouldn't it be nice if someone thought of all the things we should record and just made a template we could use? 

Oh, wait, they did.  It's called EML, and it's been around a long time.  Like carved in petroglyphs long time, in the days before a public internet existed.  


Oh, you haven't heard of it?  That's probably because what should be a time-saving template appears more like a huge technological barrier best left to tech geeks.   But it isn't.

Or at least, it doesn't have to be that way.  We just need better tools.  


## Why REML?

* The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) has been around for a while now, but has so far seen limited use.  

* R is a widely adopted among the community, many researchers already familiar with reading and writing data from R.

* R provides a rich set of data types and constructs that can be mapped into EML (e.g. integers, floats, ordered/nominal factors, character strings)



### Current state of EML

* Generation of EML is limited.  e.g. to LTER centers with informatics support. 
* Applications of existing EML more limited still (?)  

* Software to work with EML is limited to tools with low adoption rates across the community (e.g. Kepler). 

 Researchers are isolated from the metadata encoding, instead providing plain-text descriptions in MS Word documents.  Allows for low barrier of entry but also makes a barrier to richer encoding.  



### Promise of REML


### Authoring tools

### Parsing tools

### Publishing tools
