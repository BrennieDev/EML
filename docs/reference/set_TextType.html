#&gt;   The primary goal of this project is to determine experimentally the
#&gt;   amount of lead time required to prevent a state change. To achieve
#&gt;   this goal, we will (1) experimentally induce state changes in a
#&gt;   natural aquatic ecosystem - the Sarracenia microecosystem; (2) use
#&gt;   proteomic analysis to identify potential indicators of states and
#&gt;   state changes; and (3) test whether we can forestall state changes by
#&gt;   experimentally intervening in the system. This work uses state-of-the
#&gt;   art molecular tools to identify early warning indicators in the field
#&gt;   of aerobic to anaerobic state changes driven by nutrient enrichment in
#&gt;   an aquatic ecosystem. The study tests two general hypotheses: (1)
#&gt;   proteomic biomarkers can function as reliable indicators of impending
#&gt;   state changes and may give early warning before increasing variances
#&gt;   and statistical flickering of monitored variables; and (2) well-timed

#&gt;     &lt;title&gt;General Protocols&lt;/title&gt;
#&gt;     &lt;para&gt;
#&gt;     Field methods. All experiments will be carried out in the greenhouse
#&gt;     at Harvard Forest. We have developed an instrumentation system that
#&gt;     allows us to collect continuous dissolved [O2] measurements:
#&gt;     dedicated micro-probes (DO-166MT; Lazar Research Laboratories:
#&gt;     http://www.shelfscientific.com/) connected to multiplexers and data
#&gt;     loggers (AM16/32B multiplexer, CR-1000 datalogger and control system
#&gt;     [Campbell Scientific: http://www.cambellsci.com]). The initial
#&gt;     ecosystem composition in all experimental plants will be
#&gt;     standardized by seeding each pitcher with a 10-ml inoculum of liquid
#&gt;     collected from pitchers growing at Tom Swamp. In all experiments,
#&gt;     prey will be supplied to pitchers as standardized aliquots of dried
#&gt;     and finely ground bald-faced hornets (Dolichovespula maculata;
#&gt;     Hymenoptera: Vespidae), which we collect in quantity throughout New
#&gt;     England. Both hornets and ants (the latter are the dominant prey of
#&gt;     S. purpurea) are hymenoptera, and have nearly identical C:N ratios
#&gt;     (hornets: 3.97; common bog-dwelling ants [Tapinoma sessile and
#&gt;     Myrmica lobifrons]: 3.37), but on average hornets have greater than
#&gt;     100 times the dry mass of these ants, and are easier to collect and
#&gt;     process as a standardized food source. Additions of prey, either as
#&gt;     large &quot;pulses&quot; or chronic &quot;presses&quot; are
#&gt;     analogous to the enrichment and eutrophication that occur in aquatic
#&gt;     &quot;green&quot; food webs in which phytoplankton abundance is
#&gt;     boosted through addition of limiting nutrients. In &quot;brown&quot;
#&gt;     food webs such as the Sarracenia microecosystem, detritus - not
#&gt;     primary production - is at the base of the web, and our treatments
#&gt;     boost this material as would happen through increases in arthropod
#&gt;     prey capture78 or through nitrogen-enriched precipitation.
#&gt;   &lt;/para&gt;
#&gt;     &lt;para&gt;
#&gt;     Proteomic analysis. Proteomic profiles of microbial communities are
#&gt;     determined after separating the microbial fraction from the pitcher
#&gt;     fluid, prey, and other detritus. The microbial &quot;pellet&quot; is
#&gt;     subjected to SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel)
#&gt;     electrophoresis; bands are cut out and digested in-gel with trypsin.
#&gt;     Tryptic peptides are subjected to LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography
#&gt;     tandem mass spectrometry) for peptide and protein identification.
#&gt;     Absolute abundance of peptides and proteins are quantified using
#&gt;     AQUA (Absolute QUAntification) analysis109.
#&gt;   &lt;/para&gt;
#&gt;   &lt;/section&gt;
#&gt;   &lt;section&gt;
#&gt;     &lt;title&gt;Specific Experiments&lt;/title&gt;
#&gt;     &lt;para&gt;
#&gt;     Experiment #1. Effects of nutrient enrichment on state changes and
#&gt;     [O2] profiles. This experiment alters nutrient enrichment rates to
#&gt;     characterize the [O2] profile and the transition to the anaerobic
#&gt;     state. The experimental design is a one-way layout with 5 treatment
#&gt;     groups: one control (no enrichment) and 4 enrichment levels (0.125,
#&gt;     0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg prey added ml-1 d-1). One plant is assigned to
#&gt;     each treatment group, and the entire set is replicated 6 times over
#&gt;     successive weeks. [O2] is monitored continuously for 4 days to
#&gt;     characterize state changes and tipping points under different
#&gt;     enrichment rates. This experiment tracks a continuous [O2] profile
#&gt;     but does not include proteomic analysis. The purpose of Experiment
#&gt;     #1 is to identify an enrichment rate E that generates a long
#&gt;     pre-tipping period before transition time T to the anaerobic state.
#&gt;     This enrichment rate will be used in Experiments #2 - #4.
#&gt;   &lt;/para&gt;
#&gt;     &lt;para&gt;
#&gt;     Experiment #2. Identification of early intervention time and
#&gt;     characterization of aerobic and anaerobic proteomes. This experiment
#&gt;     will use the single enrichment rate E determined from Experiment #1
#&gt;     and impose different intervention times I at which nutrient
#&gt;     enrichment will be terminated. Thus, this experiment will identify
#&gt;     the latest time I* at which it is possible to intervene and stop the
#&gt;     transition to the anaerobic state by halting enrichment. The [O2]
#&gt;     profile will again be monitored continuously over 10 days to measure
#&gt;     the state of the system. From Experiment #1, the transition time T
#&gt;     to the anaerobic state with no intervention will be known. We will
#&gt;     use one control group (no prey addition) and ten levels of
#&gt;     intervention time (all with the same enrichment rate E) as a
#&gt;     proportion of T (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0).
#&gt;     Six plants will be assigned randomly to each of the 11 treatments in
#&gt;     a randomized one-way layout and [O2] profiles will be monitored
#&gt;     continuously. In addition to the [O2] profiles, we will also
#&gt;     characterize the protein profiles of aerobic and anaerobic pitchers
#&gt;     in all 11 treatment groups at the end of the experiment.
#&gt;   &lt;/para&gt;
#&gt;     &lt;para&gt;
#&gt;     After the plants are harvested, we will create proteomic profiles of
#&gt;     the predominantly bacterial portion (centrifuged pellet) of the
#&gt;     pitcher fluid from each plant, as described in General Protocols.
#&gt;     Thus, 66 separate pellet-fraction samples will be analyzed by
#&gt;     SDS-PAGE. After examining the SDS-PAGE profiles, approximately ten
#&gt;     proteins that show dynamic patterns consistent with state change and
#&gt;     five that do not change will be cut from the gel, subjected to
#&gt;     in-gel tryptic digestion and a portion of the tryptic peptides will
#&gt;     be analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Using these data, we will choose three
#&gt;     identified peptides from each protein for peptide synthesis such
#&gt;     that each synthesized peptide contains stable isotope labels (AQUA
#&gt;     peptides) to distinguish them by mass from the native peptides. We
#&gt;     will then quantify all 45 of the native peptides from the original
#&gt;     samples using a known amount of each AQUA peptide spiked into the
#&gt;     tryptic digest. The AQUA analysis of proteins that do not show
#&gt;     changes will be used for normalization between samples. These data
#&gt;     will be used to independently identify the current state of the
#&gt;     system and forecast the time-to-transition.
#&gt;   &lt;/para&gt;
#&gt;     &lt;para&gt;
#&gt;     We will use Sequest searches for initial identification of peptides;
#&gt;     relevant scores including Xcorr and Delta Cn values will be given
#&gt;     for each peptide. Other peptides will be identified by de novo
#&gt;     sequencing using PepNovo; all PepNovo scores will likewise be given
#&gt;     including any N- or C-terminal gaps. Mass error in ppm will be
#&gt;     reported for each precursor ion. We will use standard multivariate
#&gt;     analysis to search for distinctive proteomic profiles114 that
#&gt;     characterize aerobic and anaerobic ecosystems, as well as ecosystems
#&gt;     that developed with and without inputs of photosynthetic O2 and
#&gt;     plant metabolites.
#&gt;   &lt;/para&gt;
#&gt;     &lt;para&gt;
#&gt;     Experiment #3. Identification of diagnostic proteins. Using
#&gt;     Experiments #1 and 2, we will have identified an enrichment rate E
#&gt;     with a long pre-tipping period and an intervention time I* before
#&gt;     which mitigation and termination of enrichment will prevent
#&gt;     eutrophication. Experiment #3 will characterize the mean and
#&gt;     variance of the protein profile before and after I*. We are
#&gt;     especially interested in identifying proteins that increase rapidly
#&gt;     in abundance (or variance) well before the onset of flickering in
#&gt;     [O2] and before the transition time T from the aerobic to the
#&gt;     anaerobic state.
#&gt;   &lt;/para&gt;
#&gt;     &lt;para&gt;
#&gt;     A cohort of 100 plants all will be fed at rate E (determined from
#&gt;     Experiment #1), with intervention time I* determined from Experiment
#&gt;     #2, although no intervention will be used in this &quot;press&quot;
#&gt;     experiment so that we can contrast proteins before and after the
#&gt;     state change. At seven times before I* and three times after
#&gt;     I&lt;emphasis&gt;, we will harvest 10 randomly chosen plants. At each
#&gt;     prescribed harvest time, we will measure [O2] and collect samples
#&gt;     from each plant for proteomic screening using both SDS-PAGE and AQUA
#&gt;     analysis. This experiment will identify proteins that rise quickly
#&gt;     in abundance during the pre- I&lt;/emphasis&gt; period and can be used as
#&gt;     early indicators of a future tipping point. Because different plants
#&gt;     will be harvested at each time period, this is a one-way ANOVA
#&gt;     design, with pre-and post- I* a priori contrasts. A randomization
#&gt;     test will be used to determine whether variances in protein
#&gt;     expression differ through time. During these analyses we will use
#&gt;     the data from the AQUA peptides and from known amounts of protein
#&gt;     standards, such as bovine serum albumin, to approximate the amount
#&gt;     of protein in a given coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel band. The
#&gt;     reason for doing this is to provide a fast &quot;real-time&quot;
#&gt;     assay based just on expression in the SDS-PAGE. This rapid assay
#&gt;     will be used in Experiment #4.
#&gt;   &lt;/para&gt;
#&gt;     &lt;para&gt;
#&gt;     Experiment # 4. Proof-of-application. This experiment will provide a
#&gt;     benchmark test of our methods and their ability to correctly
#&gt;     identify tipping points. A cohort of 100 plants will each be fitted
#&gt;     with [O2] probes and started on the enrichment regime. Two times per
#&gt;     day, we will collect 3 plants each, pool their contents, and conduct
#&gt;     a rapid screen in the lab with SDS-PAGE for the diagnostic proteins
#&gt;     that were identified in Experiment #3. We will use the protein
#&gt;     expression in the gel to delineate an &quot;early&quot; and a
#&gt;     &quot;late&quot; mitigation strategy. As soon as diagnostic proteins
#&gt;     measured in the SDS-gels are at abundances that signal we are at
#&gt;     0.5×I* - approximately one-half of the way to the latest
#&gt;     intervention time - we will randomly select one third of the
#&gt;     remaining plants for mitigation and termination of enrichment (the
#&gt;     &quot;early&quot; mitigation strategy). We will continue to harvest
#&gt;     plants from the remainder of the cohort and monitor proteins. As
#&gt;     soon as diagnostic proteins signal we are at 0.75 times I*, we will
#&gt;     randomly select one half of the remaining plants for mitigation and
#&gt;     termination of enrichment (the &quot;late&quot; mitigation
#&gt;     strategy). The remaining plants (approximately one sixth to one
#&gt;     third of the original cohort) will continue to be enriched. We will
#&gt;     monitor [O2] in all 3 groups (no-mitigation control, early
#&gt;     mitigation, late mitigation) until all plants reach a new [O2]
#&gt;     equilibrium. If the protein markers are successful, the proportion
#&gt;     of food webs that remain aerobic will be significantly higher in the
#&gt;     two mitigation treatments than in the no-mitigation control.
#&gt;   &lt;/para&gt;
#&gt;   &lt;/section&gt;
